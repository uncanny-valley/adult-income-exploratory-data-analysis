# Exploring Adult Income Data

This data comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It describes individuals through various demographic, socioeconomic, and educational factors, with the goal of predicting whether they make greater than 50K in income.

This repository is intended for practice with exploratory data analysis and presentation for technical stakeholders. The Jupyter notebook contains more detailed explanations and initial hypotheses about the data and the corresponding presentation PDF summarizes that information. I recommend viewing the version of the presentation with speaker's notes [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1oA2lIp3jSKbUce5jdRBey43W9GSSBO9SbBYU1k_dENM/edit?usp=sharing)
